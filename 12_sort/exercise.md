1. Run the three algorithms discussed in this chapter with string data rather than
numeric data and compare the running times for the different algorithms. Are the
results consistent with the results of using numeric data?
>버블정렬,선택정렬,삽입정렬 알고리즘에 숫자대신 문자열 데이터를 적용해보고, 성능을 비교하시오
숫자 데이터를 이용했을때와 어떤 결과의 차이가 있는지 확인하시오.
2. Create an array of 1,000 integers already sorted into numeric order. Write a program
that runs each sorting algorithm with this array, timing each algorithm and comparing
the times. How do these times compare to the times for sorting an array in
random order?

3. Create an array of 1,000 integers sorted in reverse numerical order. Write a program
that runs each sorting algorithm with this array, timing each algorithm, and compare
the times.

4. Create an array of over 10,000 randomly generated integers and sort the array using
both Quicksort and the JavaScript built-in sorting func
